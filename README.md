# Design

* ## Colour Scheme
    * ### The main colors i used for this website is:
        * rgba(220, 106, 106, 1) a coral based color
        * White color for the texts

* ## Typography
    * The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

# Testing

### My methods for testing my webpage consisted of:

* Chrome DevTools is used to detect problems and test responsiveness.
* W3C Markup Validation Service
    * The W3C Markup Validation Service is used to check whether there were any errors in the HTML5 code.
* W3C CSS validator
    * The W3C CSS validator is used to check whether there were any errors in the CSS3 code.
* PEP8
    * The PEP8 validator is used to check whether there were any errors in the Python code.


* In the future I plan to implement automated tests.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
* Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

### 7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
